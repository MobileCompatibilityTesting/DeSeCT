# DeSeCT
Device Selection for Compatibility Testing

This page contains the source code of DeSeCT, as well as instructions to replicate the experiments reported in a paper submitted to SSBSE 2020.
The approach is based on DEAP framework to select mobile devices in compatibility testing.

## Experimental Data

- The dataset with the devices' features can be found in 'Dataset/dataset_desect.xlsx'
- The raw data we collected and analyzed in the paper can be found ...??

## Experiments

### Install

- Install Python version 3.7 and package installer pip. 
- Install dependencies using the following command.

```
pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt
```

### Execution

- Execute the following command:

```
python desect-approach.py 
```

This will show 3 graphs; you need to close each graph to see the next one.
